<h1>Camden Maps</h1><p>A mapping service for finding local amenities within the London Borough of Camden.</p>
<p>Camden Maps is a single-page user-friendly responsive web application. It displays the location of council-run services and live streetworks occurring within the London Borough of Camden as well as local information specific to a Camden postcode.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="/assets/monitor-primary.jpg" class="cm-image"></p>

<h2>CHALLENGE</h2><p>Camden Council had a home-grown web application that provided information regarding live streetworks, local services and local information. The problem was that the previous site was completely outdated. This meant that the app was not designed for mobile use, it did not fit in with the Camden&#39;s latest accessibility guidelines and it was built on an inconsistently formatted XML API.</p>
<p>The poorly formatted XML API was particularly troubling for Francois Mounier, who is Head of Development Services at Camden. He is passionate about open source projects and was very keen to open up the API in order to make it easily accessible for anyone to use. Francois was introduced to Founders &amp; Coders through a mutual connection. He later discovered that we were formed on the premise of developing our software skills through collaboration and open source projects. This is very much aligned to how Camden runs their in-house engineering and delivery practice. As an opportunity arisen Camden asked Founders &amp; Coders to pitch to work on a specific delivery part of the Camden transformation programme aimed at improving digital services.</p>
<p>We were thrilled to take on the challenge, collaborate with Camden Council and build their new web app to their specifications.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="/assets/latter.jpg" class="cm-image"></p>

<h2>SOLUTION</h2><p>Once a formal agreement had been established, Founders &amp; Coders and Francois arranged a date to commence their weekly conference calls. This was the beginning of the discovery phase where we established with his team key features of the app and defined many of its aesthetics.</p>
<p>Weekly meetings with Francois continued throughout the course of the project. This was important to us, because at Founders &amp; Coders we manage the development of our software through Agile principles. This means that we can ensure the quality of our software at every stage, by continuously delivering iterations of the project to the client. Most importantly, it means that we are able to adapt quickly to any changing priorities that the client may have, without it being too costly to the overall delivery. A weekly show and tell with Francois provided the heartbeat of the project ensuring we delivered on our weekly commitments.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="/assets/mobile.png" class="cm-image"></p>

<p>We wanted the app to be supported by as many devices as possible, but still feel like a native app. To do this we took a mobile-first approach, by designing wireframes for mobile followed by scaled-up wireframes for the desktop. This meant that the core logic behind the app was the same across all devices, with only small styling differences between devices, preventing the necessity to write two different completely separate web apps for desktop and mobile. From a very early stage we drove the UX-oriented redesign with user testing, ensuring the high quality of usability.</p>
<p>We built the app on a JSON REST API converted from the XML data provided by Camden Council. We documented the API using <em>Swagger</em> to ensure that it was accessible to anyone that may want to use it. The technology stack that we chose was <em>Node.js</em>, <em>hapi</em> and <em>AngularJS</em>. This enabled us to make a number of RESTful web services using JSON over HTTP to support the app&#39;s fuctionality. Having javascript as the main programming language across all technology tiers with JSON to pass information between tiers increased productivity throughout the development process.</p>
<div class="quote">
         &quot;The level of energy and commitment from the team and the wider Founders &amp; Coders community throughout the project was fantastic. They were determined to make it a success. The fact that they shared our vision regarding software delivery meant that we were able to embed them into an existing programme of work with low overheads. Weekly sprint commitments ensured we mitigated the risk around working with a new partner. We delivered the Alpha release ahead of time and launched our Beta on the day we set ourselves at the start of the engagement.”
