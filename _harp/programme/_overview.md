We have graduated more than 150 students on our full-time programme. Over the last two years, more than 90% of our graduates have gone on to work in software or a related field.

We believe that high quality education should be accessible to everyone. Our students continue to be involved with our programme long after they graduate. With their support and the work of the broader Founders & Coders community, we continue to offer our programme free at the point of delivery.

As of February 2017, we offer two programme locations: [London](/programme/course-information/london), UK and [Nazareth](/programme/course-information/nazareth), Israel.

### Pre-course introductory study

Prospective students use online materials to teach themselves the fundamentals of programming and have the option to attend  weekly in-person meetups at the Founders & Coders campus while they are preparing and submitting their applications to the course.

Visit [our Meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/) to learn more.

### 16-week full-time coding bootcamp

Our immersive course is peer-led and project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns delivering seminars, running code reviews and managing projects. The course covers test-driven development, using a full JavaScript stack (JavaScript and Node.js) with both relational and non-relational databases, as well as aspects of UX design and product management.

### 10-week full-time mentorship + portfolio building + job interviews:

During this period, every bootcamp graduate is expected to:

* Spend up to twenty percent of their time mentoring the next cohort.
* Complete up to four portfolio projects with local businesses, startups, or non-profit organisations.
* Begin applying for positions with our recruitment partners.

### Employment

Each place on the Founders & Coders programme costs us about £2,500 to provide. We ask you to consider either seeking employment with one of our partners who will help pay for these costs or, alternatively, making a regular voluntary contribution after you graduate as a way of 'paying it forward', so that we can provide a place for someone in a future cohort.
