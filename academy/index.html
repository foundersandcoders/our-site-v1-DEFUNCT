		<h1>The programme</h1><p><img src="/assets/fac-logo.png" class="fac-logo"></p>
<p>Founders &amp; Coders runs an intensive full-time, 16-week course in software development using JavaScript and Node.js. Application is highly-selective and we take just 16 students per cohort. After graduation, we expect all of our students to help us deliver the course to the next cohort and to contribute to our various community projects.</p>
<!-- We encourage applications from demographics that are underrepresented in the tech industry, particularly women.  -->

		<div id="apply"></div>
		<h1>Applications</h1><p>Our June 2016 course is now full, thank you to all who applied!</p>
<p>We are now taking applications for the Autumn 2016 cohort (starting in October), based at our Bethnal Green campus.</p>
<h2>The application process</h2><ul>
<li><a href="apply1.html">Application form, Part 1</a> (the shorter one)</li>
<li><a href="apply2.html">Application form, Part 2</a> (the longer one)</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also request a short in-person paired programming session (remote sessions can also be arranged).</p>
<p>We offer places throughout the months leading up to the application deadline. Early application is recommended, so we know that you are interested and can keep an eye out for you in our community.</p>
<h2>Minimum application requirements</h2><p>We will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme. Our minimum requirements provide the guidance you need to achieve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach at least 5 kyu on <a href="http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript">Codewars</a>;</li>
<li>Create some kata on <a href="http://www.codewars.com/kata/new">CodeWars</a>;</li>
<li>Contribute to <a href="https://github.com/codingforeveryone">our community on GitHub</a>
(e.g. our <a href="https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs">READMEs</a>);</li>
<li>Remain active in <a href="https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone">our Gitter chatrooms</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Your application will not be considered until you have met all these requirements.</p>
<p>If you have no coding experience, creating kata on Codewars and getting familiar with GitHub will take time, but please do not be daunted. </p>
<p>We encourage you to seek help and encouragement from other applicants. Join us on GitHub, and ask questions on <a href="https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone">Gitter</a>.</p>
<p>Please be aware that meeting the minimum criteria alone will not secure you a place. Our course is highly collaborative and as such, we take great care to also achieve a diversity of skills and backgrounds on each cohort. Our aim is to create the best <em>team</em> learning environment for every cohort, not to simply have a set of great <em>individuals</em>.</p>
<p>Please also note that this programme is intended for people without a background in computer science or software engineering. If you have already worked professionally as a software engineer or studied computer science at university, then this programme is probably not for you.</p>

		<div id="prerequisites"></div>
		<h1>Course prerequisites</h1><p>We have chosen these resources as our entrance criteria. If you are not comfortable coding at this standard by the time the course starts you may struggle. These tasks are part of how we will measure whether you are a good candidate for the course as well as whether you can learn in the collaborative environment here. You do not need to have completed these prerequisites before you send in your application, but you should at least have made a good start on them. </p>
<p><strong>Complete Beginners</strong><br>If you are completely new to coding, run through these Codecademy tracks first (in this order).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web">HTML &amp; CSS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website">Make a Website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript">Javascript</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube">YouTube API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We are not looking for a row of 100% completed tracks, if you have studied this before you can skip sections but you will need to understand the full content above.</p>
<p>After those tracks, run through <a href="http://flukeout.github.io/">CSS Diner</a> (we love this!), to reinforce CSS selectors.</p>
<p><strong>Codewars</strong><br>We want you to reach at least <strong>5kyu</strong> on <a href="http://codewars.com">codewars</a>. This is going to take a minimum of 3 weeks and more likely a few months depending on how much time you can spend working on it.  </p>
<p>It takes a while to get the hang of Codewars (it&#39;s quite different to and a jump up from Codecademy). We&#39;ve written our own guide to Codecademy and Codewars <a href="https://github.com/codingforeveryone/learning-with-codewars-and-codecademy">here</a>, which will help you on your way.</p>
<p>You might feel like you need more preparation. If so, take a look at chapters 1-4 of <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf">Eloquent Javascript</a>.  It&#39;s helpful for understanding functions and their uses in Javascript and builds nicely on where Codecademy ends.</p>
<p>Finally, sign up to Stack Overflow and look at some answers given for Javascript questions. The community can be a little intolerant of duplicated questions, so we&#39;ll brief on the techniques for asking questions when you arrive. Come join our Gitter channel where we chat about Codewars, Codecademy and other learning resources.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended</strong><br>We won&#39;t judge you as a candidate on these grounds, and they are not completely necessary, but they will put you in a better place for the course.</p>
<p>Codecademy tracks we would recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-intermediate-en-NJ7Lr/0/1">Regex</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-lesson-205/0/1">Recursion</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It would help greatly for you to be a relatively quick typist. <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">Typing Club</a> is good (and free).</p>
<p>Learn some hotkeys on your computer. It will help with switching between programs on your computer, using your browser efficiently and so on.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf">Eloquent Javascript</a> is a good idea, but it can get heavy after Chapter 4, so don&#39;t worry if you find it difficult as it will start to make sense during the course. <a href="http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf">Javascript: The Good Parts</a> is written by the God of Javascript, Douglas Crockford, but the diagrams are difficult to follow and it gets equally heavy as Eloquent.</p>
<p>Watch parts 2 and 3 of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&amp;list=PL7664379246A246CB">Crockford on JavaScript</a>. A wonderful series of lectures by the same Crockford as above. A panoramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. These two talks are hard to follow, but anything you can take from them is valuable.</p>
<h4>Extras</h4><p>If you have some spare time, or fancy a break from Codewars, these resources are just for fun!</p>
<p><strong>Reading</strong><br><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">Paul Ford - What is Code?</a> is a great article about his impression of the tech industry and the life of a programmer. It&#39;s long, but quite light to read.</p>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">Steve Yegge&#39;s Google platforms rant</a> shows you how passionate someone can be about their tech company&#39;s philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Watching</strong><br><a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a>, a talk by Bret Victor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tk09c0FQ3M&amp;feature=youtu.be">Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future</a>, a talk by Ed Lazowska.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o&amp;feature=youtu.be">The Future Doesn&#39;t Have to Be Incremental</a>, a talk by Alan Kay.</p>
<p>Anything with Douglas Crockford in!</p>

		<div id="faq"></div>
		<h1>FAQ</h1><p><strong>What is the Founders &amp; Coders programme?</strong><br>It is a 16-week programme of study in software development for the web.  </p>
<p><strong>How frequently do your programmes run?</strong><br>We run three programmes a year, starting in February, June, and October. Exact dates will be confirmed nearer the time, so check back regularly for updates.  </p>
<p><strong>What is the aim of the programme?</strong><br>To give students sufficient skills to create web applications and find employment as a web developer.</p>
<p><strong>What is the structure of the programme?</strong><br>It is divided into two parts: a 10-week foundation followed by 6 weeks working on real-world projects.</p>
<p><strong>How is the foundation course delivered?</strong><br>As a full-time classroom-based course running Monday to Friday from 10am to 7pm at our campus in Bethnal Green.</p>
<p><strong>How is the classroom organised?</strong><br>Classes are peer-led and project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns to deliver seminars, run code reviews and manage projects.</p>
<p><strong>What does the curriculum cover?</strong><br>Primarily, we cover <em>test-driven</em> development, using <em>JavaScript</em> and <em>Node.js</em>. We also cover aspects of UX design, product management and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><strong>What projects will I work on in the second part of the programme?</strong><br>We aim to give you an opportunity to work on a variety of open source, charitable and social enterprise projects. The programme is under continuous development and the balance between learning and creating useful software is under continuous review.  </p>
<p><strong>Will I be able to earn a living as after I complete the programme?</strong><br>We cannot offer you any guarantees, but the employment success rate of recent alumni is very high. We will do everything that we can to help you find freelance projects on completion of the programme and full-time employment when you are ready to move on.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main reasons to apply for this programme?</strong><br>The quality of the learning experience. The commitment of your fellow students. The <em>Founders &amp; Coders</em> community.</p>
<p><strong>Who is this programme suitable for?</strong><br>There are no academic requirements, but you need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure. </p>
<p><strong>Do you accept applications from abroad?</strong><br>We do welcome international students onto the programme as long as they are intending to stay and work in London after they graduate. The programme is provided free and in return we expect you to contribute to our community. You will need to be eligible to study and work in the UK. We are currently unable to provide assistance with visas or accommodation.  </p>
<p><strong>Why are the prerequisites so tough?</strong><br>This programme is challenging and you need to be well-prepared. We aim for a zero drop-out rate, so we need to know that you are serious about becoming a developer before we accept you on to the programme. </p>
<p><strong>How competitive is the entry?</strong><br>Very. We get many applicants for each place.</p>
<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong><br>There are no fees, but students and graduates are expected to help us deliver the programme to the next cohort and to contribute to our various community projects. You will also need to cover your own living expenses for at least 6 months, to cover the length of time required to complete the programme and find work.</p>
<p><strong>How are you supporting yourselves?</strong><br>By working on freelance projects. None of us is paid for teaching or mentoring on the programme.</p>
<p><strong>If this programme is so good, why are you offering it for free?</strong><br>We are trying to build a community and we do not think we can do that by charging an entry fee.</p>
<p><strong>How can I give something back?</strong><br>Almost as soon as you arrive, we will invite you to get involved in helping us run our various free programmes. After the 16-week programme is finished, we will expect you to help us deliver the programme to our next cohort of students.</p>

		<div id="why"></div>
		<h1>Why JavaScript?</h1><p>We love many languages, including C, Python, Ruby, Perl, Lisp, Go and Haskell, but JavaScript is the language of the Web. You cannot be a front-end Web developer without knowing JavaScript. With the arrival into the mainstream of Node.js, JavaScript is now an excellent choice for back-end Web development. And with new technologies like <em>PhoneGap</em> and now Facebook&#39;s <em>React</em> library, it can be used for <em>iPhone</em> and <em>Android</em> development, too. If you want to be a Web developer, JavaScript will be useful to you wherever you go.</p>
